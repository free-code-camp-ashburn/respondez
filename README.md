# About
- The Respondez App is a lightweight event management system
- It was named off of the popular expression "respondez s'il vous plait", or R.S.V.P. for short 
- I want to built this out of the desire for our [Free Code Camp Ashburn Group](https://free-code-camp-ashburn.github.io/website/) so we can manage our events external from popular platforms such as Facebook or Meetup
- Best used for other Free Code Camp Groups who want to have their own Event/RSVP/Comment system

## Features
- Log in and authenticate with your Github account
- Event system for user to create, update, and remove their events
- RSVP system for user to add and remove their responses
- Comment system for user to write and delete their comments
- Events attend system for user to view past attended events

## Minor Features
- Rule of 3: The event list, user attended list, and the update event lists will only show the latest 3 entries respectively
- Spinning loader during login and page loading
- Deleted events are also removed from a user's attended list
- View user github description on hover over rsvp photo of Attendees section
- View date and time of comments on hover of Comments section
- View location of events on hover of My Events section
